# Power_Plant_Energy_Prediction_Using_PyCaret

This problem was taken from the website named Machine Hack which is a platform that post Data Science Hackathon.

It is a regression problem. I have used Extra Tree Regression Algorithm to predict the output which gave me final RMSE: 0.1951 and R2: 0.9616

In this project, I first time used the 'PyCaret' library. PyCaret let's you code less and with comparing different model at a same time with just few lines of codes. 
I really loved working with the library.
